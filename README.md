ONLINE STORE

This Java console application is an interactive online store simulation designed for use in a basic command-line environment. 
It allows users to browse a list of products, add items to a virtual shopping cart, review their cart, and proceed to checkout. 
The application reads its product inventory from a CSV file and supports user-driven operations such as viewing items, adding products by ID, removing items from the cart, and confirming a purchase with change calculation.

The intended users are individuals looking to practice or understand how a simple e-commerce system works in Java, particularly using core Java features such as file I/O, object-oriented programming, array lists, and user input via the console.

This project helps solve the problem of simulating an end-to-end shopping experience without needing a graphical interface or database. It is especially useful as a learning tool for students or developers who are beginning to explore Java for software development.


Technologies Used
Java: Version 17 (or the version you used)

IntelliJ IDEA: For development and execution

ArrayList: To manage inventory and cart contents

Scanner: To handle user input via the console

Future Work
Add input validation and error handling for better user experience

Implement product quantity tracking to prevent duplicate or over-limit cart entries
